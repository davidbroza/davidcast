//! macOS-specific responsiveness tweaks. Two things live here:
//!
//! 1. Window-show animation suppression. NSWindow's default is a slide-in
//!    that can take ~250ms — measured as the dominant cost in our open-paint
//!    metric after we parallelized the backend. Setting animationBehavior to
//!    `.none` makes ⌃Space appear to draw instantly.
//!
//! 2. App Nap opt-out. macOS aggressively throttles "background" apps —
//!    davidcast as a menu-bar accessory with a hidden window qualifies.
//!    After a few minutes of idle, the next ⌃Space pays a wake-up tax
//!    (CPU clock-up, possibly page faults) that we've measured at 11s in
//!    pathological cases. Calling NSProcessInfo.beginActivity with the
//!    user-initiated option keeps us out of nap. We retain the returned
//!    Activity in a static so it isn't released.
