# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

All commands run from `desktop/` (the only active package; `extension/`, `worker/`, `mcp/` in `PLAN.md` are aspirational and not yet scaffolded).

```bash
pnpm install                  # bootstrap (pnpm only — pnpm-lock.yaml is committed)
pnpm tauri dev                # full dev: vite on :1420 + Rust hot reload
pnpm dev                      # frontend-only (rarely useful — no Tauri APIs)
pnpm build                    # tsc --noEmit + vite build (this IS the typecheck)
pnpm tauri build              # release .app at src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos/

cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml                  # all Rust tests
cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml <name>           # one test by name
cargo check --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml                 # fast Rust typecheck
```

There is no JS test runner and no separate lint step — `pnpm build` is the only frontend gate. Rust tests live inline as `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` (see `actions.rs`, `agents.rs`, `commands.rs`).

`pnpm tauri` is wrapped (`desktop/scripts/tauri.sh`) so every `pnpm tauri build` (regardless of where it's invoked from — justfile, CI, or directly) runs `desktop/scripts/patch-info-plist.sh` afterwards, which inserts `LSUIElement=true` into the bundle's `Info.plist`. Tauri 2's bundle config can't set arbitrary `Info.plist` keys, and `LSUIElement` is what tells macOS the bundle is a true menu-bar utility — without it the palette can't float over another app's fullscreen Space, even with `NSWindow` level=screensaver and `CanJoinAllSpaces`. `dev` and other tauri subcommands `exec` straight through.

## Architecture

**One Tauri app, two webviews, one Rust core.** `desktop/src-tauri/src/lib.rs` owns startup: it loads the JSON store into a `RwLock<Store>` managed by Tauri, registers the `⌥ Space` global shortcut, builds the menu-bar tray, and sets `ActivationPolicy::Accessory` so there's no dock icon. The frontend bundle is shared between two windows — `main` (the palette) and `prefs` — distinguished at runtime by `?view=prefs` in the URL; `desktop/src/main.tsx` reads that param and mounts either `App` or `Preferences`.

**Frontend never touches disk.** Every read/write goes through Tauri commands in `commands.rs`, wrapped on the JS side by `desktop/src/api.ts`. Adding a new command requires three coordinated edits:
1. Define the `#[tauri::command]` in `commands.rs`.
2. Register it in the `invoke_handler![...]` macro in `lib.rs`.
3. Add a wrapper in `src/api.ts`.
If the command touches a window or plugin not already permitted, also add the permission to `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json`.

**Commands that block MUST be `async`.** In Tauri 2 a synchronous `#[tauri::command]` (`pub fn`) runs on the **main/UI thread** — so a slow or hung command freezes the entire app, *including the menu-bar tray* (the "Quit" item stops responding, and the user can only force-quit via Activity Monitor). Any command that shells out (`docker`/`ps`/`lsof`/`git`/osascript), hits the network, or does non-trivial disk I/O must be `pub async fn` so it runs on the async runtime instead. An `async fn` with no internal `.await` still works and still runs off the main thread — you don't need to make the body truly async, just the signature. `State<'_, T>` is allowed in async commands. Pure in-memory / tiny-config commands can stay sync. **And no subprocess shell-out may use a bare `Command::output()`** — route it through `proc::capture_stdout` / `proc::output_with_timeout` (`proc.rs`), which spawns with stdin=`/dev/null`, drains the pipes, and kills the child past a deadline. This is what stops `docker ps` (hangs when the Docker daemon is starting/wedged), `lsof` (stale mounts), and `git push/pull` (unreachable remote) from wedging the app. Git network calls also set `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` so a credential prompt fails fast instead of blocking forever.

**Store layout is workspace-scoped, sync-ready.** `Store::load()` (`store.rs`) creates `~/Library/Application Support/davidcast/` with `config.json` (workspace list + active id) and per-workspace `workspaces/<id>/{snippets,quicklinks}.json`. Workspace membership is implicit in the file path — items themselves don't carry a `workspace` field. All writes are atomic (write-temp-then-rename in `write_json`). `delete_workspace` intentionally leaves the directory on disk for safety.

**Items are sync-shaped from day 1.** Every `Snippet` and `Quicklink` (`types.rs`) has `id` (UUIDv7), `created_at`, `updated_at`, `deleted` (tombstone — never hard-delete), and `rev` (monotonic). The phase-2 Cloudflare sync engine is designed to plug into these fields without a migration. Don't hard-delete, don't reuse fields.

**Palette is a heterogeneous list.** `list_palette` in `commands.rs` returns `Vec<PaletteEntry>` — a tagged union of `Command | Snippet | Quicklink | App | Agent`. The frontend (`components/Palette.tsx`) runs Fuse.js fuzzy search across all of them in one pass. Built-in commands (`builtin_commands()`) are how features like "Create Snippet", "Open Preferences", "Switch Workspace" surface — they're searchable entries with stable ids dispatched in `App.tsx`'s `onCommand`.

**macOS-specific bridges (osascript).** Two flows shell out to AppleScript:
- `actions.rs::paste_at_cursor` — sends `⌘V` via System Events. Fails silently without Accessibility permission; the snippet still lands on the clipboard.
- `agents.rs::activate_*` — finds the terminal tab matching a `tty` and brings it forward (iTerm2 + Terminal supported; others fall back to `open -a`).

**Agent detection.** `agents.rs` runs `ps -axo pid,ppid,etime,tty,comm,args`, filters for `claude` (direct binary or `node /.../claude/cli.js`), uses `lsof` for cwd, and climbs the PPID chain to identify the parent terminal app. Pure subprocess work — no proc filesystem assumptions.

**Window auto-hide.** The palette hides on blur (`on_window_event` in `lib.rs`) — that's intentional and what makes `⌥ Space` feel like a launcher. Don't add focus-stealing UI inside the palette window or it will dismiss itself.

## Conventions worth knowing

- **`PLAN.md` and `README.md` are authoritative** for product scope and the phased roadmap. `FEATURES_PLANNED.md` is a scratchpad — implementations there may already be shipped or may be stale.
- **No CSP** (`tauri.conf.json` sets `csp: null`) — this is intentional for the local-only app, not an oversight.
- **Raycast import quirks** live in `commands.rs::normalize_raycast_url` and `import_from_file` — Raycast's `{argument name="x"}` becomes `{x}`, and `openWith` bundle ids map to the `OpenIn` enum. Tests cover this.
- **Hotkey is hard-coded** to `⌥ Space` in `hotkey.rs::default_shortcut`. Rebinding UI is on the roadmap, not built.
- **Commit messages**: never mention Claude Code as the tool; the model name is fine (per user's global instruction).

## Features (keep this list current)

The user-facing "Show Help" view (`desktop/src/components/Help.tsx`) is the source of truth for what davidcast can do. **When you add, remove, or rename a feature, update both this list and `Help.tsx` in the same change.** The list below mirrors the groups in the Help view; it exists in CLAUDE.md so future-you can see the full surface without opening the app.

- **Palette basics** — `⌥ Space` toggles the floating launcher (`hotkey.rs`). Hides on blur. Fuzzy search via Fuse.js across every entry kind in one pass (`Palette.tsx`).
- **Snippets & Quicklinks** — per-workspace, sync-shaped on disk. Built-in commands: `create.snippet`, `create.quicklink`, `search.snippets`, `search.quicklinks`. Inline display can be turned off in Preferences (`show_snippets_inline`, `show_quicklinks_inline` in `Config`); when off, items only surface under the Search filter command. Snippet rows never render the body text in their subtitle (privacy — palette is often visible during screen-sharing); only the keyword surfaces. Snippets carry a `sensitive: bool` flag (default false) — when true the row badges as "🔒 Sensitive" and the edit form starts with the textarea masked behind a Peek/Hide toggle. Run/paste behavior is unchanged either way.
- **Apps** — installed macOS apps with real icons (`apps.rs`, `icons.rs`).
- **Agents** — `show.agents` lists running Claude CLI sessions; Enter activates the terminal tab (`agents.rs` + osascript).
- **Vite ports** — `show.vite` lists detected dev servers (`vite_ports.rs`); inline display gated by `show_vite_inline`.
- **Docker** — `show.docker` lists running containers with two rows each (shell + logs) via `docker_ps.rs`; inline display gated by `show_docker_inline`.
- **Files** — `files.find` runs an `fd`-backed search with `:png` / `:img` / `:newest` filter tokens (`files.rs`). `files.screenshots` is a dedicated mode with a side preview pane and ↵-copies-path semantics. ⌘C copies path, ⌘⇧C copies image bitmap (PNG/JPEG only), ⌘R reveals in Finder, ⌘↵ opens in default app. Screenshot search auto-resolves the macOS screenshot location via `defaults read com.apple.screencapture location` and merges it with any user-configured dirs (so a stale `screenshot_dirs` entry never silently zero-results), expands `~/`, and includes `.mov` / `.mp4` so screen recordings show up alongside stills.
- **Skills** — `skills.search` browses Claude Code SKILL.md files under `~/.claude/skills` (personal) and `~/.claude/plugins/cache/<marketplace>/<plugin>/<version>/skills` (installed plugins). Side preview pane shows the markdown body (`skills.rs` parses YAML frontmatter; `Palette.tsx::SkillPreview` renders). ↵ copies path, ⌘⇧C copies the full skill body (read via `read_skill`), ⌘↵ opens in default editor, ⌘R reveals.
- **Clipboard history** — `⌘⇧V` opens it directly (clipboard hotkey in `hotkey.rs`); `show.clipboard` is the discoverable command. Background watcher in `clipboard.rs`.
- **Window management** — `wm.left/right/top/bottom/maximize/center` move the frontmost (non-davidcast) window via osascript with the standard 60ms hide-then-act trick (`window_mgmt.rs`, `commands.rs::run_wm`).
- **System stats** — `show.stats` opens an inline view (`components/Stats.tsx`) with CPU load, memory pressure, disk usage, battery (% + state + time-remaining), and thermal pressure. Pure shell-outs in `stats.rs` (sysctl / vm_stat / df / pmset). One snapshot per `system_stats` invocation; the view auto-refreshes every 2s while open. Page size for memory math is read from `vm_stat`'s header so it works on both Apple Silicon (16K pages) and Intel (4K).
- **System quick actions** — Raycast-style: `system.lock` (⌃⌘Q via System Events), `system.sleep` (`pmset sleepnow`), `system.empty_trash`, `system.restart`, `system.shut_down`, `system.log_out` (`system.rs`). Reversible actions (lock, sleep) fire immediately; destructive ones go through a native `ask()` confirm in `App.tsx::confirmAndRun` so a fuzzy-match Enter can't power-cycle the machine. macOS itself still surfaces its own confirm sheet on restart/shutdown/logout — the app-level prompt is the *first* gate, not the only one.
- **Themes** — `themes.switch` lists built-ins plus any JSON dropped in `~/Library/Application Support/davidcast/themes/`. Selecting one writes `Config::theme` and applies CSS variables on the document root (`themes.rs`, `App.tsx::applyTheme`). Built-ins: Default Dark, Light, High Contrast, Dracula, Nord, Tokyo Night, Solarized Dark/Light, Gruvbox Dark, Hacker (green-on-black), Retro Amber CRT, Pixel (8-bit), Nerd (JetBrains Mono), plus the weird/tribute set (Synthwave, Vaporwave, Game Boy, Hot Dog Stand, Brutalist, Cyberpunk, Bubblegum, Newsprint, Matrix, Comic Sans, LCARS, Star Wars, Stargate, Red Dwarf, Pokémon, DOOM, GTA V, The Boys). Committing a theme triggers a celebratory burst — confetti by default; **The Boys** fires a Homelander-style heat-vision lance via `lasers.ts` (mirrors `confetti.ts`, also reachable as the `fx.lasers` built-in command). Theme tokens include `font-family` / `font-family-mono`, so a theme can swap typography too — three woff2 fonts ship bundled (`Press Start 2P`, `VT323`, `JetBrains Mono`) under `desktop/src/assets/fonts/` and Vite fingerprints them into `dist/`. Custom themes can reference any system-installed font name in those tokens.
- **Workspaces** — `switch.workspace` (`⌘K`) opens the inline switcher. CRUD lives in Preferences. Items are scoped per-workspace by directory layout (`workspaces/<id>/{snippets,quicklinks}.json`).
- **Preferences** — `open.preferences` (`⌘,`) opens the inline preferences view (autostart, search filters, plugin toggles, screenshot dirs, workspaces, Raycast import). Implemented as a `View` kind in `App.tsx`, not a separate window.
- **Help** — `help.show` opens this list inside the app (`components/Help.tsx`).
- **Import** — Preferences → Import. Auto-detects Raycast quicklink/snippet JSON exports (`commands.rs::import_from_file`, `normalize_raycast_url`).
- **Analytics** — local-only JSONL append (`analytics.rs`). Never network. Used by recents-bias scoring in the palette. `show.analytics` opens an inline view (`components/Analytics.tsx`) that aggregates the log via the `analytics_summary` command — top queries, top items, kind breakdown, last-30-days opens sparkline, success rate, average dwell, plus a "Clear log" button. The aggregation is pure (no I/O in the test path) and unit-tested in `analytics.rs::tests`.
- **Recommendations** — opt-in on-device recommender (`recommend.rs`, off by default via `Config::enable_recommendations`). Trains a 7-weight logistic regression from `analytics.jsonl` over per-item features: bias, log frequency, exponential recency (~7-day half-life), log P(time-of-day | item) over 4 buckets, log P(weekday | item), same-session bonus (last 30 min), and kind prior. Training walks the log chronologically, snapshots `(positive_features, negatives)` at each execute event (with a synthetic zero-stats negative so even early single-item events produce a training pair), then runs 5 shuffled epochs of pairwise SGD with L2. State persists at `~/Library/Application Support/davidcast/recommender_state.json`. A 5-min background thread in `lib.rs` retrains when there are ≥30 new events. **No "Recommended for you" section.** When the toggle is on, score becomes the primary sort key for the empty palette (with a small dead-zone to fall through to recents on near-ties), so highly-scored items naturally rise to the top of one continuous list — no headers, no pinning. The model still tracks `confidence_threshold` internally; it's surfaced in Preferences but no longer drives a section break. Lookup key matches the analytics log shape (`${kind}:${shortName(entry)}`) so freshly logged executes line up with model state. The Preferences "Recommendations" section shows trained-at, sample count, current top items + scores, learned weights, plus Retrain / Reset buttons. All local — same posture as analytics.
- **Auto-updater** — `tauri-plugin-updater` polls `https://github.com/davidbroza/davidcast/releases/latest/download/latest.json` on launch (toggle in Preferences, default on) and via the `app.check_updates` built-in command. Updates are minisign-signed; the public key is in `tauri.conf.json::plugins.updater.pubkey`, the private key lives only as the `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` GitHub Actions secret. The release workflow tarballs each `.app`, calls `tauri signer sign` on the tarball, then writes a `latest.json` with the signature contents and uploads everything to the GitHub Release. The frontend renders an `UpdateBanner` at the bottom of the palette when a newer version is available — Install & restart triggers `downloadAndInstall()` then `relaunch()`.
- **Git backup** — `backup.rs` shells out to the system `git` CLI to push the entire store directory to a user-supplied remote. Working tree IS the data dir; .git lives at `<data_dir>/.backup-git/` so it stays out of sight. No credential storage — auth piggybacks on whatever lets the user `git push` from terminal (SSH key, gh CLI, credential helper). The `Config::backup` block holds enabled/remote/branch/include_analytics/last_synced_ms/last_error/auto_interval_min. A 60s background thread in `lib.rs` calls `backup::sync` when enabled + initialized + dirty + at least `auto_interval_min` minutes since last push. Manual Sync now / Pull / Force push (`--force-with-lease`) buttons live in Preferences → Backup. `.gitignore` is regenerated on every sync from the current `include_analytics` flag (default off — the log contains every query). Conflicts: pull --rebase happy path; on diverged history, sync errors out with "use Force Push or resolve manually" — per the user's design, the app never auto-resolves cross-machine conflicts.

When this list and `Help.tsx` drift, the user notices because the Help view is a button-press away — keeping them aligned is part of "feature done".
